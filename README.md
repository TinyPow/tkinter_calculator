# Tkinter calculator
A calculator built in python using customtkinter.

The code is 100% written by me but the design is heavily inspired on the default windows calculator so i decided to include the licence.
## Dependencies
The following modules are required to run the app.
* customtkinter
* Requests

The following modules are used but come with the python standard library.
- Os.path
- Json
- datetime
- ctypes
- math
- platform
## Currency converter
The app has a currency converter with exchange rates that are updated every day

The api used is Exchange rate API and only allows one request per day, so if you delete the app folder and rerun the app the currency converter may not work
